Eternal Atake<br>
Gotta shoot two at her (yeah)<br>
Gotta shoot two at her (whoa)<br>
Blue cheddar<br><br>
That girl, she got with my clone<br>    
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better (whoa)<br><br>
Are you serious?<br>
I swear my money is serious<br>
Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it<br>
She sucked my dick 'til she get delirious (wow)<br>
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it (woo)<br>
Okay port, but I'm not talking New' (let's go)<br>
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette<br>
If that boy try to make a false move, uh (damn)<br><br>
I'm on some whole other shit<br>
I got a whole 'nother rich, I'm on a new level<br>
I was fuckin' on your bitch<br>
She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't be two pedals<br>
I swear these niggas, they bitches<br>
I swear they all gonna snitch when my niggas gon' shoot at 'em<br>
Niggas, they mad about this<br>
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em<br>
She saved my name in her phone<br>
Only thing she saved me under is probably that "U" letter (hello?)<br>
No, I don't got provolone<br>
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar<br>
She tried to leave me alone<br>
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better<br>
I know it's blue cheese on me<br>
But when I got 50s on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (ha)<br>
Jeremy Scott's all on my feet<br>
I had a cougar with me so I call that girl Coretta<br>
I am the richest nigga in my city<br>
I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather (facts)<br>
I know that girl, she got swag<br>
But when it come to putting it together, she could do better<br>
I sent that girl a DM<br>
She ain't answer me, so you know that I gotta shoot two at her (yeah)<br>
Gotta shoot two at her (yeah)<br>
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (and you are Lil Uzi? Vert, let's go)<br>
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (whoa)<br>
That girl, she got with my clone<br>
I told that lil' girl that she gotta just do better, whoa (one, two, three, let's go)<br><br>

Okay, all my checks, I just be clearing it<br>
She sucked my dick 'til she get delirious<br>
Okay, jump on the jet so I'm clearing it<br>
Okay port, but I'm not talking New' (woo)<br>
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette<br>
If that boy try to make a false move (whoa)<br><br>
They try to cut me down<br>
When they say I'm too low (turn me up)<br>
I said turn me up, I cannot hear my flow (whoa)<br>
I ain't never been no fool<br>
Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules (whoa)<br>
I'ma take the dub, I'ma win<br>
I ain't ever been no type that lose, yeah<br>
Born like this, I ain't did no study<br>
Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry<br>
If I love you, better say that you love me<br>
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me<br>
Talk 'bout the bag, the mula, the guap<br>
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm running<br>
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop<br>
I'm running through obstacles, I'm in a hurry<br>
Whoa, stop that<br>
Told a fuck nigga just drop that (yeah)<br>
If you shoot first, we gon' pop back<br>
Margiela on me, lil' nigga, that's not that<br>
What you got on? Prada sweatsuit made of nylon<br>
See my righteous girl, yeah, she says, "Right on"<br>
When I hit that girl right with the light on<br>
When I hit that girl, oh<br><br>
Gotta shoot two at her<br>
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (whoa)<br>
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (whoa)<br>
That girl, she got with my clone<br>
